Some of my projects here include:

- [AdaptiveResonance.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/AdaptiveResonance.jl): a Julia package for Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) algorithms.
- [ClusterValidityIndices.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/ClusterValidityIndices.jl): a Julia package for incremental and batch cluster validity indices (CVI/ICVI), which are unsupervised metrics for clustering performance.
- [NumericalTypeAliases.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/NumericalTypeAliases.jl): a Julia package for abstract and concrete type aliases that I often use in my Julia packages and research repos.
- [PyCallJLD2.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/PyCallJLD2.jl): a Julia package for saving and loading PyCall.PyObjects with JLD2.
