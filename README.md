# ✨ _About Me_ ✨

My name is Sasha Petrenko, and I am a Ph.D. candidate of computer engineering at Missouri S&T in Rolla, MO.
I have a background in aerospace engineering, and my current research focus is lifelong machine learning.

> Why is your handle @AP6YC?

If you read it like its in Cyrillic, it spells "arboose", which means watermelon in Russian.

Some of my projects here include:

- Julia packages:
  - [AdaptiveResonance.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/AdaptiveResonance.jl): a Julia package for Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) algorithms.
  - [ClusterValidityIndices.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/ClusterValidityIndices.jl): a Julia package for incremental and batch cluster validity indices (CVI/ICVI), which are unsupervised metrics for clustering performance.
  - [MetaICVI.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/MetaICVI.jl): a Julia package implementing the [MetaICVI](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.21685214) hybrid unsupervised metric method that I coauthored.
  - [NumericalTypeAliases.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/NumericalTypeAliases.jl): a Julia package for abstract and concrete type aliases that I often use in my Julia packages and research repos.
  - [PyCallJLD2.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/PyCallJLD2.jl): a Julia package for saving and loading PyCall.PyObjects with JLD2.
  - [Rocket.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/Rocket.jl): a Julia package implementing the [Rocket](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-020-00701-z) method (that I did not author, just a fan).
- Python packages:
  - [cvi](https://github.com/AP6YC/cvi): a Python package for incremental and batch cluster validity indices (CVI/ICVI), a complement to my Julia implementation at [ClusterValidityIndices.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/ClusterValidityIndices.jl).
  - [metaicvi](https://github.com/AP6YC/metaicvi): a Python package for the [MetaICVI](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.21685214) hybrid unsupervised metric method that I coauthored, a complement to my Julia implementation at [MetaICVI.jl](https://github.com/AP6YC/MetaICVI.jl).
- Research repos:
  - [DCCR](https://github.com/AP6YC/DCCR): a research repository implementing the experiments for my paper [_Lifelong Context Recognition via Deep Feature Clustering_](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.23653737)
- Others:
  - [dark-future](https://github.com/AP6YC/dark-future): a collection of original and modified VSCode color themes with a special focus on Python and Julia syntax highlighting.
